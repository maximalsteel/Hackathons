# Data Scientist Salary Prediction

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the salary range of data scientist job postings in India. Using a dataset with attributes such as company name, years of experience, job description, job designation, job type, key skills, and location, the model aims to provide insights into factors influencing salaries.

I achieved a rank of 83 on the leaderboard for this hackathon project.

# Hackathons
Welcome to my Hackathons repository! This repository contains all files from my hackathon projects, including code, datasets, documentation, and presentations. Each folder represents a different hackathon, organized for easy access. Explore, review, and gain insights from my innovative solutions!

## Data Scientist Salary Prediction

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict the salary range of data scientist job postings in India. Using a dataset with attributes such as company name, years of experience, job description, job designation, job type, key skills, and location, the model aims to provide insights into factors influencing salaries.

I achieved a rank of 83 on the leaderboard for this hackathon project.

## Flight Price Prediction Project

In this project, I developed a machine learning model to predict flight prices using data from various airlines between March and June 2019. The workflow included data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to achieve accurate predictions.

## Workation Price Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning to predict per-person prices for workation packages across India, with over 18,000 records. The workflow involved text preprocessing, encoding, and advanced modeling. The goal is to find the best deals for a balanced work and leisure trip.
